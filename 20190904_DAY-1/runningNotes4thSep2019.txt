1. What is Cloud Computing?

Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including
servers,
storage,
databases,
networking,
software,
analytics, and
intelligence—over the Internet.

The cloud offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
You typically pay only for cloud services you use,
helping lower your operating costs,
run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
2. Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is providing developers and IT departments with the ability to
focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work like
procurement,
maintenance, and
capacity planning.

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and
deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users.

Each type of cloud service, and deployment method, provides you with different
levels of control, flexibility, and management.

Understanding the differences between
1. Infrastructure as a Service,
2. Platform as a Service, and
3. Software as a Service,

as well as what deployment strategies you can use, can help you
decide what set of services is right for your needs.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
3. Cloud Computing Models

There are three main models for cloud computing.

Each model represents a different part of the cloud computing stack.

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) :

Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS,
contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to
networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and
data storage space.
Infrastructure as a Service provides you with the highest level of flexibility
and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT
resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS) :

Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying
infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus
on the deployment and management of your applications.

This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource
procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the
other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.


3. Software as a Service (SaaS) :

Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and
managed by the service provider.

In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to
end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how
the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed;
you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece software.
A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send
and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email
product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.
